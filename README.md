Recipe 111: web application for a chatbot that provides mental health support.
Libraries: Streamlit, OpenAI API, Pandas, NLTK

Description: A web application for a chatbot that provides mental health support.

Instructions:
Set Up Streamlit: Create a new Streamlit application.
User Input: Allow users to input their thoughts or feelings.
Text Processing: Use NLTK to preprocess the input text if necessary.
OpenAI API Integration: Send the text to the OpenAI API for empathetic response generation.
Display Response: Show the chatbot's response on the web page.
User Interaction: Allow users to provide feedback or ask follow-up questions.

Sure, here’s an outline of how you can set up your Streamlit application for a mental health support chatbot using the specified libraries:

Main.py

import streamlit as st
import openai
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

Set up OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

Streamlit App
st.title("Mental Health Support Chatbot")
st.write("This chatbot provides empathetic responses to support mental health.")

User Input
user_input = st.text_area("Share your thoughts or feelings:")

Text Processing
if user_input:
    nltk.download('punkt')
    tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
Additional preprocessing can be done here if needed

OpenAI API Integration
    response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-003",
      prompt=f"Provide an empathetic response to the following input:\n{user_input}",
      max_tokens=150
    )

Display Response
    chatbot_response = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    st.write("Chatbot:", chatbot_response)

User Interaction
    feedback = st.text_input("Would you like to provide feedback or ask a follow-up question?")
    if feedback:
        st.write("Thank you for your feedback or question!")


Instructions

Set Up Streamlit:
   Install Streamlit using pip install streamlit.
   Run your app with streamlit run main.py.

User Input:
   Use st.text_area to capture user input.

Text Processing:
   Use NLTK for tokenization or any other preprocessing steps.

OpenAI API Integration:
   Replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.
   Use the openai.Completion.create method to get responses.

Display Response:
   Use st.write to display the chatbot's response.

User Interaction:
   Allow users to provide feedback or ask follow-up questions with st.text_input.

Notes

Ensure you handle API errors and edge cases.
Consider adding more sophisticated text preprocessing if needed.
Make sure to secure your API key properly.

This setup provides a basic structure. You can expand on it with more features or functionality as needed.
